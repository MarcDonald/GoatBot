# GoatBot

GoatBot is a customisable Twitch bot that allows you to easily create new commands using JSON files.

## Local Setup

* For the bot itself, [see the bot's README file](./bot/README.md).

## Important Note

GoatBot was created as a way to learn Go and as such is probably not in a state to be used in a real world scenario.
